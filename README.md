As a new user I am prompt to create a profile when I first visit the page. I will then be able to fill in my name and select to view my interests/preferences. I can then edit my preferences on the top right of the site.  As a user I can write down what my thoughts are throughout the day and save it to my phone/computer. I'm able to view my notes from previous days when I click on archive on the bottom section.
